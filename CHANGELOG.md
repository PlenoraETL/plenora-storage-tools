# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — prepared for release

- Add bounded CLI pagination within one process (`list --all`).
- Enforce FTP parent-probe deadlines and cancellation.
- Qualify SFTP atomic replacement with the OpenSSH POSIX rename extension.
- Reject oversized declared uploads before opening destinations; account for
  parent directory effects in failure and recovery reporting.
- Validate provider configurations and transport policies during preflight.
- Bound CLI connection-file reads; handle Unix SIGTERM and conservative panic outcomes.
- Make fixture skips explicit and qualify HTTPS, SSH pins and all three providers.
- Upgrade rustls for RUSTSEC-2026-0285 and refresh yanked dependencies.
- Package all five crates with licenses and versioned dependencies; build Windows
  and Linux candidates, validate extracted archives, and emit SHA-256 manifests.
- Qualify lost multipart commit responses, late commits, deadlines and SIGTERM;
  exercise SFTP commit interruption and staging cleanup without deleting the final object.
- Enforce canonical runtime UUIDs, preserve optional causation identity, and
  report route mismatches as protocol errors before invocation.
- Generate validated adoption manifests v4 with actual artifact digests and
  run the runtime binding suite from the packaged core crate.
- Promote the v1 catalog to available; the old experimental flag remains accepted.
- Require matching committed sources, platform evidence and dependency gates
  before sealing a release as qualified for publication.
